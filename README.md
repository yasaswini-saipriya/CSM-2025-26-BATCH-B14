🛡️ Transformer-Driven Botnet Detection Framework
📘 Overview
This repository presents a novel, real-time botnet detection and analysis framework powered by Transformers and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). It addresses key limitations in traditional graph-based detection systems—such as poor generalization, scalability bottlenecks, and lack of interpretability—by combining deep learning, streaming analytics, and explainable AI.
🚀 Features
